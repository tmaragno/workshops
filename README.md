This is a compendium of workshops I'm putting together for various audiences. Please feel free to browse around. Below you will find the workshops that I'm working on.

## Workshops
1. Microservices using Docker
   * Participants will build 2 containers that communicate with each other. The first is a REST NodeJS Server which will provide a response to a NodeJS client running on the second container.
